<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<h4>This movie is awesome and since it is on the perspective of Bateman there is a lot of mistery and details to it </h4>
<br />
<h3>In the tall grass</h3>
<h4>Most movies don't use the concept of paradox much, but this one did it in an Interestellar level, mix this with a great story and you get my second favorite movie</h4>
<br />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<h4>An interesting and well told story with a plot twist to end it all in the best way possible, also the soundtracks are sick</h4>
