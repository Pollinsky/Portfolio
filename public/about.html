<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a web developer who wants to start a startup called Nicocat where artists can sell paintings to
   middle class citizens all across the world for an affordable price and low commisions fee.
   The site will be stylish and minimalistic with my cat (Nicodemus A. The first) being the face and mascot 
   of the company.</p>
